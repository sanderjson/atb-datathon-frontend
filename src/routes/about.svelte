      Many want to go green. Many don’t like finance. We help people reach their
      environmental giving power by understanding their finances. We then
      connect them to local green causes, so they can drive change by unleashing
      their “Giving Power”.

    <p>
      Charities suggest giving level based on donation history, with past gifts
      set as the minimum. Other competitors allow for set goals, but you have to
      decide your giving amount based off of your perceived financial situation
      and what the herd is contributing. We empower users to understand their
      circumstances, that their finance situations change, but your impact
      doesn’t have to. We emphasise local environmental change and have a
      database of vetted local charities for wherever you go.

    <p>
      As Open Banking becomes a global phenomena, there is pressure on
      traditional banks to compete with FinTech companies and stay relevant with
      their customers. More customers are valuing corporate social
      responsibility from the organisations they interact with. We is designed
      for banks to help empower users to understand their “Giving Power ™”,
      their opportunity to make social change, derived from their financial
      data.
